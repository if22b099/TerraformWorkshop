### Why do we need Terraform Cloud (or another backend) when we use CI/CD?

While CI/CD pipelines can automate the application of Terraform configurations, using Terraform Cloud (or another backend) provides several critical advantages:

1. **State Management**: Terraform Cloud securely stores the state file remotely. This avoids potential conflicts and ensures that changes applied by one pipeline or developer don't overwrite or corrupt the state managed by another.

2. **Collaboration**: By centralizing state and locking it during changes, Terraform Cloud prevents multiple CI/CD pipelines or developers from running `terraform apply` simultaneously, which could lead to resource mismanagement or downtime.

3. **Secrets Management**: Terraform Cloud handles sensitive information (like provider credentials) securely, reducing the risk of exposing them in CI/CD pipeline logs or configuration files.

4. **Access Control**: Terraform Cloud provides role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring only authorized individuals or pipelines can apply infrastructure changes.

5. **Execution Environment**: Terraform Cloud offers a consistent and secure environment for running plans and applies. This eliminates discrepancies caused by differences in local or CI/CD environments.

6. **Audit and Visibility**: Terraform Cloud tracks all operations, providing a clear audit trail of who applied what and when. This is often required for compliance in production environments.

7. **Policy Enforcement**: With features like Sentinel in Terraform Cloud, you can enforce policies (e.g., restrict certain resource types or regions) before applying changes, adding an extra layer of governance.

8. **Ease of Multi-Environment Management**: When managing infrastructure across multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production), Terraform Cloud simplifies configuration and state separation, reducing complexity in CI/CD pipelines.

In short, while CI/CD automates deployment workflows, Terraform Cloud (or another backend) ensures safe, consistent, and collaborative infrastructure management. It complements CI/CD by addressing the unique challenges of managing Terraform at scale.
